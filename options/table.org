* Mainstream Blogging Options

   - There are three ways of creating the required website: using
     Blogger, Wordpress, and Ghost. Unfortunately, /none/ of these are
     static, which means they cannot be hosted on GitHub Pages.
   - As such, prior to our implementation of the website, it must
     /first/ be hosted on a webserver which supports dynamic webpages.
   - It is also a good idea to host first since domain names tend to
     be "squatted" when interest is shown.
   - This table assumes your billing cycle is annual to minimize
     monthly cost, since buying on a per-month basis is far more
     expensive.
   - Each of Blogger, Wordpress, and Ghost provide a certain feature
     set, and are priced somewhat differently.
   - This table compares these by assigning a difficulty score for the
     implementation of any given feature, with 0 being built-in, and
     10 being impossible. (Lower is better).

   - The final rows deal with the ease of use and maintenance on the
     user's (your) end, which should give an idea of how much support
     will be later required.
   - Note that sending emails /without/ Wordpress, Ghost, or MailChimp
     almost assures that they'll be trapped by a spam filter and never
     actually read by a human.

As such, *Ghost* is the most cost-effective and fully-featured option
of the three. Blogger is nearly obsolete and difficult to use.
Wordpress is the most customizable, but requires a lot of work and
money to run smoothly.


* GitHub Pages: Zero Cost, Static

  There is one more, possibly zero-cost option. GitHub provides a
  hosting page for free. However, the domain must end in =.github.io=,
  and has a certain technical learning curve (which can be taught in a
  one hour session). Emails will have to be
  sent manually (=cc=), and email data also collected manually, since
  there's no server-side database support.

  However, the advantage of GitHub pages is the *zero upfront cost,
  forever*, and the possibility to eventually shift to a non-GitHub
  domain without having to stop using Pages.

  Let us know which of the four (3 mainstream or GitHub) options you
  want to move forward with, and we'll coordinate from there.
